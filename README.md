The project was done using MATLAB's App Designer
My code filters distorted audio signal using the Fourier transform and amplitude modulation
By inputting a carrier frequency (in Hertz), the user can hit the start button which will exhibit the spectral analysis of the filtering process
Then, the user can choose to hear the origianl audio signal compared to the filtered audio signal based on which carrier frequency they chose
